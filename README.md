Blog web application was built using Ruby 2.5.1, and Rails 5.2.4.

Built this application to showcase the usage of Websockets via Rail's ActionCable. Also implemented Redis to sync data across all instances of the application.

Production version of the repository can be found at: https://message-action-cable-app.herokuapp.com/
